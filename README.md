Python implementation of automatic Tic Tac Toe game using random number


Tic-tac-toe is a very popular game, so let’s implement an automatic Tic-tac-toe game using Python. The game is automatically played by the program and hence, no user input is needed. Still, developing an automatic game will be lots of fun. Let’s see how to do this. NumPy and random Python libraries are used to build this game. Instead of asking the user to put a mark on the board, the code randomly chooses a place on the board and put the mark. It will display the board after each turn unless a player wins. If the game gets drawn, then it returns -1.
